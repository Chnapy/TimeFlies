# Team

A team is composed of one or multiple players. This group of player is represented by a letter, like **A** for instance.

Teams are defined during room stage.
When a player joins a team, all its characters join it. A player cannot share several teams.

A battle consists of teams confrontation, with the unique goal to letting only a single one of them in the battle.

A team loose the battle when all its characters die. On the other hand, if a team is the only one remaining in the battle the latter ends with this last team as winner (so all its players win also).
