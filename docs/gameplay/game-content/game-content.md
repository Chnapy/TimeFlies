# Game content

All the mutable content, that can change over the time, like entities.

This content can change very often, since entities can be created, removed or modified at any time. Doing any change on them related code should be quite easy.

## Characters roles

Each character role has its own attributes values, and spells.
For comparaison this is default attributes values:

| Attribute | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| Life | 100 |
| Action time | 10s |

Each role has 4 spells, generally composed of:
- 1 for placement
- 1 for support
- 2 for attack

But this is not systematic.

Each spell has its own attributes values, and effects.
