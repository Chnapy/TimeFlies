This part describes how the game works, and how players can play it.

## In summary, it's a chess game

Timeflies is a multiplayer, online, tactical-RPG.
But "tactical-RPG" doesn't mean a lot, so let imagine a concrete example: **a chess game**.

In a chess game you play with another player. Imagine you can play with several players, each one can be your *ally*, or your *ennemy*: there is **teams**.

Each of these players have pawns, towers, king, queen etc. These *entities* are your **characters**. You can use them on the game board to play moves, the goal being to erase ennemies characters.

If in a chess game players play these moves one after the other, in Timeflies the game is *turn-based*: each character plays one after the other. Also **turns** have *duration*. When this duration has elapsed, the turn ends and the next character plays its turn.

The main originality of Timeflies is how characters moves are handled. In a chess game a player can do only one move. In Timeflies as long as the current character turn is not ended he can continue to play any move the player wants, with the only condition that these moves should end before the turn end.

To be more understable I used until there the term "moves", but it's actually **spells**. Characters have spells which can be used during there turns. Each of these spells have a duration, some spells can last 4 seconds, others 12, for instance. They can hurt other characters, or heal, move, etc.

Finally, when only one team remains on the board, game ends.
