## :clap: Credits

Games can be complex and hard projects, especially when they're done alone.
This is why for Timeflies I used several external assets which helped me a lot.

  - [RPG Dungeon Tileset](https://pita.itch.io/rpg-dungeon-tileset) and [RPG Monster Pack](https://pita.itch.io/rpg-monster-pack) 
  (tileset and characters spritesheets) by [Pita](https://pita.itch.io/),

  - [100 Pixel Icons](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/100-pixel-icons-3836/) 
  (spells icons) by [Frostwindz](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/member/Frostwindz/),
